## Lemonade Insurance Company: Redefining the insurance industry
Lemonade is an innovative insurance provider that was established in 2015 and provides services like life, renters, homeowners, and pet insurance. Although Lemonade offers similar services to other insurance providers, it has fundamentally altered the customer experience.

Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger, the creators of Lemonade, are transforming the historically significant industry of property insurance into a Millennial-friendly consumer good. Dan Ariely joined in 2017 as the Chief Behavioral Officer.
Lemonade Insurance generates revenue by charging monthly fees to clients. Lemonade's business strategy is based on behavioural economics, for instance by giving away any surplus that goes unclaimed to a good cause.
_The lemonade Strategy_
Their business is operating on a straightforward strategy: “Delight Customers”.
_Mission and Vision_
Lemonade is a formally recognized public benefit corporation with the goal of 'making insurance simple again.'
Conversely,  its bigger goal is "turning insurance from a necessary evil into a societal good." They also aimed to develop into a round-the-clock insurance provider that thrills clients rather than annoys them.

### The Lemonade Financials
In 2019, SoftBank Backed Lemonade reported total sales of $63.8 million, up from $21.2 million in 2018. Its overall sales for the year were $67.3 million, while its operating costs rocketed by 133% to $175.2 million.

Sales and marketing accounted for the majority of its costs, but these costs may be readily decreased because the company had leverage due to the ground-breaking artificial intelligence technology. Even if user growth is slowing down, Lemonade's premiums increased to $76 million last year. The corporation has huge opportunities for gross profit because gross profit exceeds total sales. Long-term capital expenditure reduction is also necessary to generate some operating profit. Since the corporation has less debt, interest costs are less.
Lemonade had an operating profit margin of -169% and lost close to $108 million in 2019. The company's financial situation is continuously becoming better, and its growth rate is over 500%. For the seventh consecutive quarter, the corporation reported an improvement in the loss ratio with rising volume and numbers.

According to Crunchbase, Lemonade has raised $480 million in seven funding rounds. It’s latest Series D round valued the startup at $2 billion.
With 425,000 clients, 75% of whom were under 35 and 90% of whom were purchasing renters and homeowners insurance for the first time, Lemonade earned $57 million in premium revenue in 2018, its second full year of offering these products. The 170-person New York-based firm, which now operates in 22 states, anticipates doubling revenue this year and growing to include all 50 states as well as Europe. 
Lemonade has successfully reached this target group at a time when 73% of millennials prefer to shop online using their phones (the percentages are 2x higher for Zoomers, or Generation Z). In order to obtain insurance information traditionally, a user must get in touch with an agent, complete a form, and wait for a quote. The procedure is optimised using Lemonade to be considerably quicker and more practical. Maya the chatbot, the system's built-in AI, offers tailored support without requiring the user to speak with a real representative.
The seamless flow of clients from one function to another is what really distinguishes Lemonade's customer service. As a new user views data comparisons so they may select the best service, information relevant to their buyer persona is shown to them. When necessary, they can also conveniently access claim processing. All of this is automated, without the need to wait on hold or fill out lengthy forms.

In July 2020, Lemonade went public on the New York Stock Exchange in its largest IPO since 2020. Its market value jumped from about $ 40 million in September 2015 to $ 4 billion.

### How Lemonade is Disrupting the Insurance Industry 
 * _Strong branding_. Lemonade has carved out a distinct niche for itself
 * _Personalized service_. One of the qualities that distinguish Lemonade from other insurance companies is the level of personalized service.
 * _Flat fee_. Pricing is often confusing for insurance customers. Lemonade also appeals to millennials and other younger customers, who tend to have  less experience with insurance policies. 
 * _Giveback program_. When customers sign up for insurance, they choose a nonprofit to support. At the end of the year, any unclaimed money from an account is donated to the nonprofit.

## Lemonade Future Profitability
Lemonade continues to be a loss-making enterprise. Nevertheless, its GAAP EBITDA is estimated to break even by FY25. A key aspect towards profitability would be to reduce its gross loss ratio over time. Lemonade can also achieve this with scale. In addition, it also has to move into higher value-added products. Investors are also encouraged to monitor its gross loss ratio closely over time.

## Recommendations
For tenants who appreciate speed and simplicity and feel comfortable using a mobile app to manage their coverage, Lemonade renters insurance is a fantastic choice. Prospective customers can receive a price in just a few minutes because to the rapid and simple nature of the online quote procedure. Additionally, it is quite flexible, enabling tenants to change the coverage levels and add additional endorsements as necessary. Although submitting a claim should be quite simple, some clients might prefer a claims procedure that doesn't require a mobile app. However, some tenants might like the idea of being able to submit a claim without having to get in touch with a representative or agent.Those renters who require a hands-on, customized approach when dealing with their insurance provider might want to look elsewhere. Although agents can be contacted through the Lemonade app, some users may be put off by the absence of phone support. Due of Lemonade's very constrained coverage region, it's also probable that tenants won't be able to use the company's renters insurance. But as Lemonade, Inc. keeps growing, that coverage area might extend in the future.

## Conclusion
Although many people still can't handle the idea of ​​dealing with companies that are completely dependent on bots with no people to deal with. It is time to accept that artificial intelligence is becoming a reality and in the near future we will see more companies and industries that depend less on people and more on machines.
Undoubtedly, Lemonade has reinvented the insurance industry by using machine learning and artificial intelligence to satisfy consumers and make the ecosystem more efficient. Lemonade has made insurance more attractive, affordable, accurate, and socially more effective.
With just $128 Mn revenue in a $5 trillion industry and an innovative business model, Lemonade has the potential to become the world’s most loved insurance company one day.
